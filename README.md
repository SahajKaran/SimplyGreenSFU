Simply Green Sfu App

The Purpose of Our App.
The overall purpose of our app is to spread awareness about the current programs on
campus that support a circular economy and encourage students to use recycling services
that are provided on campus. SFU currently offers a variety of recycling services on
campus, but most students are not aware of these services or where to find them. We
want to make sure SFU students have these services readily available to find, instead of
finding them through different areas of the SFU website. There are three main ways our
app will spread awareness: by showing where all the services are on an interactive map,
explaining how each service works and linking to their respective external links, and
encouraging students to use these services. We hope by making our app simple and fast
to use, it will make the existing services on campus more accessible and prevalent to SFU
students. The app will be easy for the students to use and will not require anything more
than basic knowledge of operating an android device. Additionally, the app will not
require any user registration so all users can use the app immediately after installation.
